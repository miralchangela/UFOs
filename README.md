# UFOs

 Unidentified flying object(UFO) Sightings with JavaScript ,HTML and CSS.

## Overview of the project:

Client's requirement was to show a table which organizes UFO sighting data as an array form of JavaScript and filter with different criteria for creating a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used for modification in the website.

## Results:

### Welcome to UFO Sightings!

### The UFO sighting website with all data:

The website displays all data which is stored in a Data file. The data file provides information about sightings of UFOs. Data file contains date, city, state, country, shape, and Duration as well as comment on UFO.

### The UFO sighting website with filter:

UFO sighting websites filter by various criteria such as date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. Make sure to type everything in proper format. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter.To reset the filter criteria, refresh the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.

## Summary:

### Drawback:
The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. Few shapes like light , chevron , teardrop might not be as intuitive. The filters are case sensitive. The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as "grantspass", “grants pass_”, or "Grants Pass ".  The only acceptable input would be "grants pass".

### Recommendations:

1. The next addition to the filters should be to add a case sensitive which can accept lower and upper case inputs.

2. A filter on a date range might be preferable than a singular date.  Typing 1/2010 did not bring up all the dates from January as hoped.  Perhaps, the UFO Sightings occur more frequently in a specific month instead of a specific day within the month.  It is recommended to add in a filter function to include a date range as the filter to aid in the investigation of UFO Sightings.
